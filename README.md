# Used Car Price Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression

## Objective
Predict the price of used cars using Multiple Linear Regression after
cleaning the data, handling outliers, and validating model assumptions.

## Dataset

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Outlier removal using IQR
- Log transformation of price
- Feature selection
- One-hot encoding and scaling
- Multiple Linear Regression
- Residual analysis

## Results
- R² Score: ~0.8
- Residuals approximately normally distributed

## Technologies
